# Big data analytics for electric vehicles in the smart grid
As plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) adoption accelerates, uncoordinated charging habits during peak hours can cause power losses, overloads, and voltage fluctuations in smart grids. This thesis simulates the success rate (10% - 50%) of a hypothetical campaign encouraging consumers to charge their PEVs during off-peak hours to help alleviate grid strain. Data analytics tools and descriptive statistics are used to manipulate data and visualize results. The findings show that even a slight shift in charging behavior during peak hours can lead to a more balanced distribution of energy demand.

## ⚙️ System Requirements
* **R** and an **R IDE** (e.g., **R Studio**) are required. You can download both from the [official RStudio website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
* You will also need the following R packages: `ggplot2`, `lubridate`, `dplyr`, and `glue`. You can install them by running this command in your R console:  
```
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "lubridate", "dplyr", "glue"))
```
* To ensure correct date formatting, your computer's display language must be set to **English (United States)** in the language settings.
> [!NOTE]
> If you prefer to view the generated graphs without setting up the coding environment or running your own simulations, you can access a **Colab notebook** linked in the **About** section of this repository. This notebook summarizes Chapter 2 of the thesis, featuring key findings and relevant graphs, all generated from pre-executed code. It also provides links to additional notebooks for other chapters of the thesis, where you can explore further insights and visualizations.

## 📊 Data Sources
This thesis uses three primary datasets, which were sourced from the [National Laboratory of the Rockies (NLR)](https://data.nrel.gov/submissions/69) and were adapted for this research. The data were generated by a model simulating realistic electricity consumption patterns for the Midwest region of the United States. The first dataset contains electricity demand profiles in watts for 200 households, recorded in 10-minute intervals throughout 2010. The other two datasets contain PEV charging profiles for 348 vehicles associated with these 200 households, using Level 1 (1920 W) and Level 2 (6600 W) charging types, respectively, recorded in 10-minute intervals over the same period. Below are sample tables for each file.
